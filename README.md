Project from IT225

This project was made by Nick Souligne and me for IT225 in the Spring of 2019. While I helped Nick to understand how the software would work, Nick was the primary coder while I focused mostly on the circuits. 

The project works by taking a MIDI file, reading the note value and then sending a signal via the pins of a Raspberry Pi to an electromechanical solenoid.

A demonstration of the project is available using the following link.
